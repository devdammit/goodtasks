# Good tasks for interview on JavaScript 
Here are some good tasks that I have met on the Internet or in interviews. For a long time, I didn't create a repository to collect such tasks and show my solutions. Some of the tasks are already exist on [Codewars](www.codewars.com) or [Leetcode](www.leetcode.com), here is my own selection of tasks.



## Used Practice

- [Either monade for error handling](https://blog.logrocket.com/elegant-error-handling-with-the-javascript-either-monad-76c7ae4924a1/)
- [TDD process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)


## Tasks
All tasks divided by subjective level of complexity from 1 to 10

| Task | Description | Level of complexity |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| [maximalSquare](src/maximal_square.ts) | You have a 2D binary matrix that's filled with `0`s and `1`s. In the matrix, find the largest square that contains only `1`s and return its area. | 4 |
| [firstDuplicate](src/first_duplicate.ts) | Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. | 2 | 


## TLDR

I will be glad if you give feedback or add your interesting task(s)
